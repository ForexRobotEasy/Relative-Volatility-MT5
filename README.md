# Relative Volatility MT5

This code is a sample implementation of the Relative Volatility MT5 program developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It calculates the volatility of a given set of price data and analyzes the trend based on the calculated volatility. It also provides two trading strategies, mean-reversion and momentum, based on the volatility and a specified indicator value.

## Volatility Calculation Function

The `calculateVolatility` function takes in an array of price data and a period as parameters. It calculates the sum of price differences and then calculates the average. Finally, it calculates the volatility by summing the squared differences between prices and the average, and taking the square root of the result. The calculated volatility is returned.

## Trend Analysis Function

The `analyzeTrend` function takes the volatility as a parameter. It compares the volatility with predefined thresholds to determine the trend. If the volatility is less than 0.5, it returns 'Low Volatility'. If the volatility is greater than 2.0, it returns 'High Volatility'. Otherwise, it returns 'Medium Volatility'.

## Mean-Reversion Strategy Function

The `meanReversionStrategy` function takes the volatility and an indicator value as parameters. It checks if the volatility is greater than 1.5 and the indicator value is greater than 95. If both conditions are met, it returns true, indicating that the mean-reversion strategy should be executed. Otherwise, it returns false.

## Momentum Strategy Function

The `momentumStrategy` function takes the volatility and an indicator value as parameters. It checks if the volatility is greater than 1.5 and the indicator value is less than 5. If both conditions are met, it returns true, indicating that the momentum strategy should be executed. Otherwise, it returns false.

## Main Function

The `OnTick` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes an example array of price data and a period for volatility calculation. It then calculates the current volatility using the `calculateVolatility` function and analyzes the trend using the `analyzeTrend` function.

The main function also provides examples of how to use the mean-reversion and momentum strategies. If the mean-reversion strategy conditions are met (volatility > 1.5 and indicator value > 95), it executes the mean-reversion strategy and prints a message. Similarly, if the momentum strategy conditions are met (volatility > 1.5 and indicator value < 5), it executes the momentum strategy and prints a message.

Finally, the current volatility and the trend are printed for monitoring purposes.
